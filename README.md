### Project 2 of CS50 Web.
An eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”  

### Functionality
Users are able to visit a page to create a new listing.  
The default route lets users view all of the currently active auction listings.  
Signed in users are able to bid on the item.  
Watchlist page displays all of the listings that a user has added to their watchlist.   
If the user is signed in and is the one who created the listing, the user has the ability to “close” the auction.  
Users who are signed are able to add comments to the listing page.
